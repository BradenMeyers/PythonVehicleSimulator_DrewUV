# Python Vehicle Simulator

The Python Vehicle Simulator is a suppleement to the Matlab MSS (Marine Systems Simulator). It includes models for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), and ships. The vehicle models are based on the MSS vessel models. Each vehicle is modelled as an object in Python and the vehicle class has methods for guidance, navigation and control (GNC). The main program is:

    main.py  
    
which can be used to define multiple vehicles for real-time simulation. The vehicle classes are
are located under the catalogs: 

    /vehicles/                 Vehicle classes and methods  
    /functions/                Functions
